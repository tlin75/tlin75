### Hi there 👋
I'm Tiffany Lin, a 3rd year Actuarial Studies and Computer Science student at UNSW.

### 📚 About Me
Throughout my academic journey I have gained experience to sharpen my analytical and technical mindset as well as passion for solving complex data problems. I'm especially interested in areas of Business Analytics and Engineering and Technology where I can apply my programming skills (Python, R, SQL) and experience in statistical modelling.

- 💡 I'm passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights and building tools that solve real world problems
- 🚧 I'm currently working on building a [Cafe Finder](https://github.com/tlin75/Cafe-Finder) web app to help students and locals discover nearby cafes
- 🖥️ I recently built **[Tiny Thrive](https://github.com/tlin75/Tiny-Thrive)**, a pixel-styled desktop focus timer built with React and Electron, designed to help students stay productive with gentle reminders, timed breaks, and rotating color themes.

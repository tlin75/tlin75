### Hi there 👋
I'm Tiffany Lin, a 3rd year Actuarial Studies and Computer Science student at UNSW.

### 📚 About Me
Throughout my academic journey I have gained experience to sharpen my analytical and technical mindset as well as passion for solving complex data problems. I'm especially interested in areas of Business Analytics and Engineering and Technology where I can apply my programming skills (Python, R, SQL) and experience in statistical modelling. I'm excited to collaborate across and contribute to Stryker's team to drive patient healthcare outcomes and grow within a fast paced, detail oriented environment.

- 💡 I'm passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights and building tools that solve real world problems
- 🚧 I'm currently working on building a [Cafe Finder](https://github.com/tlin75/Cafe-Finder) web app to help students and locals discover nearby cafes
- 🌱 I recently build a program which allows Discord bot to respond to commands in a messaging channel, check it out [here](https://github.com/tlin75/Discord-Bot)
